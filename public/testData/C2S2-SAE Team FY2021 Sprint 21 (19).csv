Integrator,"Change Artifact Path For Getting Reports","Since we are using all 5 Netadmin machines we need to change the hardcoded path on line 252 in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. Instead of having the full path we need to change it too `automated-system-tests\reports`. This will allow us to get the reports regardless of the Netadmin Machine.",2021-07-13,2,17
Integrator,"Change Integrator VM Snap Shot Name to All Caps","On line 48 of the `c2s2-sae-ci-setenv.cfg` change `export SNAPSHOT_NAME=""StartPointForPCDTest""` to `export SNAPSHOT_NAME=""START_POINT""`. Going forward all cap snapshot names will be reserved for the pipeline. Lowercase/ camel case should be used for personal VMs.",2021-07-14,1,16
c2s2-sae-package,"Planning Meeting for C2S2-SAE 1.1.2.22.0","Hold planning meeting for C2S2-SAE 1.1.2.22.0 release. Ideally all team members attend.  

* [x] Create directory `\\a2dfileserver.grid\SSCPAC.Snapshots\C2S2-SAE\r\1.1.2.22.0` and create file `JustificationForChange.txt` in that directory.  
  * JustificationForChange.txt format. Use text below for initial file contents.

Justification For Change
------------------------
[TSOADEV-####] Update SRHEL to version 1.0.9.#
```
* [x] Create DI2E TSOADEV issue for SHREL update (if new), use Title and Description ""Update C2S2-SAE SRHEL to 1.0.9.n"" where ""n"" is version number, and update JustificationForChange.txt with issue number.  
* [x] Review all issues completed since the last planning meeting  
* [x] Determine if it's desired to include any subcomponent issues completed since last meeting in the next release and create new version issues as appropriate in subcomponent repos, e.g. to include a WAI bug fix a new WAI version is needed. It may be the case we do not want to include a change and hold off on creating a new subcomponent version, or we want to create a new subcomponent version and not include it in the next C2S2-SAE release.  
* [x] Make entries in the JustificationForChange.txt Component Identification section to identify the sub-component versions 
* [x] Make entries in Justification For Change section for issues needing mention in the BLD and release notes.  These include bug fixes, IA issues, and issues involving changes to install, operation, or documentation that could impact training.

  *Note:* To ensure the JustificationForChange.txt file may be used for release notes and BLD automation, please ensure the following entry format is used.  
  
  * Format: `[IssueID] Issue Title/Description`  
  * Examples:  
    - `[TSOADEV-2167] Update SRHEL to version 1.0.9.41`  
    - `[TSOADEV-1380] Fix WAI handling of spaces in hostname`  
    - `[C2AS-1299] Replace OpenAM with open source equivalent`  
    - `[C2AS-258] BRVT unable to create items`",2021-07-20,2,14

Integrator,"Make C2S2 IP Dynamic For Builds To Allow Multiple Runner","Since we have 5 available Netadmin machines to use, we want to make out IP address dynamic each time the Pipeline is ran. Right now we have a static IP coded in our CFG file. For this issue we remove need to remove that variable and add a new stage. In this stage a random IP address will be assigned to out C2S2 VM each run. The apps team has already done this, so reference the bcd-selenium project for more details.",2021-07-20,8,5
