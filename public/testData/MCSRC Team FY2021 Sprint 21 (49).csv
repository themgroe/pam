mcsrc,"Import script is losing our syslog configuration","I was doing some regression testing after merging master into s/105 and I noticed that after performing an import the configuration for syslog was blown away. This module is configured when you say yes to installing with STIGs and it is used to send drupal logs to /opt/mcsrc/logs/drupal. These logs were previously only accessible by visiting the MCSRC site Reports => Recent log messages. 

This issue may be solved by issue #386, but i'm not certain",2021-07-14,5,44
mcsrcdoc,"PCD - Total download count isn't correct when looking at older revisions","There were changes recently made to the MCSRC source code to correct the incomplete logic that handles the download counts for products. Included in these changes was the removal of the Total Downloads for Product field on older revisions. Moving forward that field will only be present on the latest revision.

SOURCE CODE: mcsrc#397",2021-07-14,2,42
mcsrc,"uProd - Feedback can be improved within our scripts","During the attempt to upgrade MCSRC to version 1.0.2.10.0 in production we encountered a few places that could provide better feedback to the user upgrading MCSRC.

Currently, we have a few places where we use a `_logWarn` to tell the user the currently running process may take a little bit of time and to be patient. We do this when the uninstall script runs and when the import script runs.

We should extend this to when we run the backup script and tell the user it can take up to several hours depending on how many GB of data is being backed up. The backup is composed of two parts: backing up the DB and backing up the private files folder. It would be nice if we provided output when the first of the two completes and the second commences.


- [x] Add the log file into the backup script.
- [x] Add a progress bar or an indicator.",2021-07-14,3,39
mcsrc,"Remove wait Spinner from log processes","When working on issue #373 we included a spinner that our Gitlab CI did not like. So we need to take it out and work on another way to show a waiting process.",2021-07-15,2,37
mcsrc,"Issue 336 was never applied to Master","Months ago we underestimated the time it would take to make S/105 our new Master branch. At the time we were thinking that was right around the corner so we thought it would be okay to make issue #336 for the s/105 branch. It turns out that s/105 has yet to become our Master branch and so the changes made in issue #336 have yet to be made in Master.",2021-07-20,3,34
mcsrc,"s/105 - Replace chcon with semanage again","This issue is for the S105 branch.  

Both **asdStigs.sh** and **site-import.sh** contain chcon commands that should be replaced with semanage, folowed by restorecon.  Output from restorecon should be piped to /dev/null (see c/347)

## Possible Solution

site-import.sh : 
```    
    chcon -R -t $selinux_type /opt/mcsrc/files/private &&
    chcon -R -u $selinux_user /opt/mcsrc/files/private; then
```

used to be:

```
   semanage fcontext -a -t $selinux_type -s $selinux_user /opt/mcsrc/files/private(/.*)? &&
   restorecon -v -R /opt/mcsrc/files/private; then
```

however we should remove the -v and pipe the output to /dev/null",2021-07-21,2,32

mcsrc,"Total download count isn't correct when looking at older revisions","Products added to MCSRC provide a download count that lets the user know how many times the product file has been downloaded. This number is correct when looking at the current/latest revision, but is incorrect when looking at older revisions.

This can probably be solved with a similar approach to the revision download count which utilizes two database tables
