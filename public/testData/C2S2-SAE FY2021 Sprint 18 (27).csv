* [x] Create directory `\\a2dfileserver.grid\SSCPAC.Snapshots\C2S2-SAE\r\1.1.2.21.0` and create file `JustificationForChange.txt` in that directory.  
  * JustificationForChange.txt format. Use text below for initial file contents.

Justification For Change
------------------------
[TSOADEV-####] Update SRHEL to version 1.0.9.#
```
* [x] Create DI2E TSOADEV issue for SHREL update (if new), use Title and Description ""Update C2S2-SAE SRHEL to 1.0.9.n"" where ""n"" is version number, and update JustificationForChange.txt with issue number.  
* [x] Review all issues completed since the last planning meeting  
* [x] Determine if it's desired to include any subcomponent issues completed since last meeting in the next release and create new version issues as appropriate in subcomponent repos, e.g. to include a WAI bug fix a new WAI version is needed. It may be the case we do not want to include a change and hold off on creating a new subcomponent version, or we want to create a new subcomponent version and not include it in the next C2S2-SAE release.  
* [x] Make entries in the JustificationForChange.txt Component Identification section to identify the sub-component versions 
* [x] Make entries in Justification For Change section for issues needing mention in the BLD and release notes.  These include bug fixes, IA issues, and issues involving changes to install, operation, or documentation that could impact training.

  *Note:* To ensure the JustificationForChange.txt file may be used for release notes and BLD automation, please ensure the following entry format is used.  
  
  * Format: `[IssueID] Issue Title/Description`  
  * Examples:  
    - `[TSOADEV-2167] Update SRHEL to version 1.0.9.41`  
    - `[TSOADEV-1380] Fix WAI handling of spaces in hostname`

The CI/CD yml needs to be updated to look in the snapshots/r directory instead.
'//a2dfileserver.grid/SSCPAC.Snapshots/C2S2-SAE/r/${VERSION}`

Rationale: ISO is copied to releases after delivery is accepted. Hash should be generated from ISO in ""release candidate"" directory which the snapshots/r dir.
